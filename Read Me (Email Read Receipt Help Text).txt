1) Please write a correct value for the "MONGODB_SERVER_URL" field in the ".env" file after
deploying a cluster of mongodb nodes as the code depends on it.
2) After choosing a domain name, please type the complete URL without the path part in the
"APPLICATION_URL" field of the ".env" file.
3) Right now, this project uses the port number 9000 and it has also been written as a field
in the ".env" file, if needed, please also modify the PORT field as well.

4) For every user account, a mongodb document is inserted in the "users" collection of the
"emailReadReceipt" database, each such document has a field named as "serviceExpirationDate"
which stores the date after which we will stop serving that user account until they get a new
subscription, after the payment has been processed, please update this "serviceExpirationDate"
field accordingly based on the package that a user has purchased.

For doing so, some helper functions which follow a very primitive approach have been defined 
in the "utils/updateServiceExpiration.js" file, please feel free to define a more general way of
updating this date field.

NOTE: The code for this project may contain parts that have been written in a non-standard
and messy way due to strict time limitations, so the focus was solely on implementing 
features that just work, please ignore this messiness if possible.
